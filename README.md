# Ideakart

Ideakart is a website that gives you an idea about the book you wants to buy.

# About this project: üôå

This is a team project, built by us in the Construct Week - Unit 2 at Masai School.

We have tried our best to make a fully-functional clone of Ideakart website that provides a minimal user experience where users can roam around and purchase the books they are looing for.
