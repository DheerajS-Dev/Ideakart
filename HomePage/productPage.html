                “Considering the fresh attention being paid to teaching a
                skeptical approach to information evaluation, this series opener
                couldn’t be better timed. A brief but savvy guide to responsible
                Research methods adds further luster to this crowd pleaser.”
                —ALA Booklist (starred review)Two Truths and a Lie is the first
                book in a fascinating series that presents some of the most
                crazy-but-true stories about the living World as well as a
                handful of stories that are too crazy to be true—and asks
                Readers to separate facts from fakes! Did you know that there is
                a fungus that can control the mind of an ant and make it do its
                bidding? Would you believe there is such a thing as a corpse
                flower—a ten-foot-tall plant with a blossom that smells like a
                zombie? How about a species of octopus that doesn’t live in
                water but rather lurks in trees in the Pacific Northwest?Every
                story in this book is strange and astounding. But not all of
                them are real. Just like the old game in this book’s title, two
                out of every three stories are completely true and one is an
                outright lie. Can you guess which? It’s not going to be easy.
                Some false stories are based on truth, and some of the true
                stories are just plain unbelievable. And they’re all accompanied
                by dozens of photos, maps, and illustrations. Amaze yourself and
                trick your friends as you sort out the fakes from the
                facts!Acclaimed authors Ammi-Joan Paquette and Laurie Ann
                Thompson have teamed up to create a series of sneaky stories
                about the natural World designed to amaze, disgust, and
                occasionally bamboozle you.
