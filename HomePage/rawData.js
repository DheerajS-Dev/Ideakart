      "Indicating ways to improve patient-outcome was the main driver writing this book. Two years of research, structuring, collecting, and writing around the central subject of our days: digital. Similar to other spheres of our lives, digital has the power to change many aspects of healthcare and improve patient's lives. Not only tells the book about the obvious, but also points to many use-cases and innovative examples of digital in health. By definition, digital interconnects and integrates people and things. Maybe some of the Players in healthcare find the idea of working across sectors harmful to their own business model? Digital in health in any case means leaving traditional comfort zones. Besides telling about the digital past and present, the book Digital in Health defines, conveys ideas, triggers concepts, and indicates digital business models and cases already existing. In contrast to what we encounter every day, digital concepts in healthcare are lagging far behind. The rest of the world has already advanced a lot further. After technology is available, the most important prerequisite for the development of digital in health evidently is the mindset of protagonists. Digital today is far more than a buzzword, after every one of us is regularly confronted with it. Today many are already depending on digital, reaching into every corner of our life. None of our today's lives could continue to function as it is, without leveraging and using all these digital tools and applications. Digital in Health wants to help pave the way for digital ideas, supporting the constant ambition to improve patient-outcome. Joining forces for the common goal of better care, the coauthors added most relevant and important views. Each from his own professional background. Many thanks to Salil Kallianpur, Gerd Luippold, Christian Milaster, and Anup Soans who contributed so greatly to the book, while living in India, Germany, and the United States of America.",

    details:
      "A detailed guide to the three successive initiatic archetypes: Craftsman, Warrior, and Magician • Investigates the symbolism, rituals, and metaphysical aspects of each initiatic archetype, from the alchemy and shamanism of the craftsman, to the subtle energy work of the warrior, to the sex magic practices and Higher Self work of the magician • Shares meditations, practices, and transformational techniques for each archetype • Investigates the similarities between contemporary Western occultism, from Crowley to Chaos Magic, and the “positive thinking” mind Metaphysics movement Exploring the craftsman, warrior, and magician archetypes--three vocations that echo the traditional tripartite division of society--Angel Millar reveals how these archetypes represent the three successive stages of spiritual growth in an individual’s life. He shows how they provide structure for the initiatory process to develop one’s mental, physical, and spiritual potential. As craftsman, the individual experiences “mnemonic” initiation: the cultivation of Memory as well as language. As warrior, “somatic” initiation: development of the physical body and cultivation of the spirit body. And as magician, “gnostic” initiation: cultivation of the self and manifestation of the Higher Self. Investigating the metaphysical aspects of each archetype, the author explores their symbolism, spiritual practices, and rituals. Examining the craftsman archetype, he looks at metallurgy, alchemy, and the “Craft” of Freemasonry, as well as the ancient role of blacksmith as shaman. He explores the idea of God as a “Creator” or “Craftsman,” especially in relation to ancient Greek philosophy, Islamic neoplatonism, and the Kabbalah. Examining the warrior archetype, he reveals how the way of the warrior was affected by Religion and mysticism, such as how the Persian martial art of Zoorkhaneh was profoundly shaped by Sufism and why the Buddhist Shaolin temple became synonymous with Kung Fu. The author places special emphasis on the cultivation of subtle energy as practiced in martial arts, especially in relation to Taoist inner alchemy. Examining the magician archetype, he reveals how each individual has two “selves”--a lower self and a Higher Self--and explores the union of opposites studied by the magician, such as in the tantric arts and sacred sex magic. Sharing meditations, practices, and processes associated with each archetype, as well as techniques for transforming one’s consciousness, he also investigates similarities between contemporary Western occultism, from Crowley to Chaos Magic, and the “positive thinking” mind Metaphysics movement. Structured to parallel the three archetypal stages of the initiatic process, this comprehensive guide offers a literary initiation through three degrees of esoteric knowledge.",

    details:
      "NOW A NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST, WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY, AND PUBLISHERS WEEKLY BESTSELLER.There has never been a more important political investigation than Robert S. Mueller III's into President Donald Trump's possible collusion with Russia. His momentous findings can be found here, complete with:The 300+ pages of the historic report, as released by the Justice DepartmentAn introduction by constitutional scholar, eminent civil libertarian, and New York Times bestselling author Alan Dershowitz.The relevant portions of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the 1999 provisions written by former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal, which establish and regulate the powers of the special counsel.Rod Rosenstein’s 2016 order appointing Robert Mueller III as special counsel and outlining the scope of his investigation.Attorney General William Barr’s four-page summary of the report, as sent to Congress.Barr's explanation of the four reasons for redacting the report, and a key for identifying them in the color-coded reportThe wait is over. Robert Mueller, a lifelong Republican, has concluded his investigation and submitted its findings to Attorney General William Barr. Barr has told Congress that Mueller found no proof of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and did not come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice—neither concluding the president committed a crime nor exonerating him. But Mueller’s report was over 300 pages and Barr’s summary was only four pages, raising questions about the conclusions of a historic investigation. Special Counsel Robert Mueller III’s probe into Russian influence on the 2016 election of Donald Trump—including links between the campaign and Russian Interests, obstruction of justice by President Trump, and any other matters that may have arisen in the course of the investigation—has been the focal point of American Politics since its inception in May 2017.  Democrats in the US House of Representatives hoped to use the report to begin impeachment proceedings, with the support of those critical of the president. Media tracked Mueller’s every move, and the investigation was subject to constant speculation by political pundits everywhere. It resulted in the indictments of Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and many others. President Trump and his supporters affirmed that the investigation was a “witch hunt” and the product of a plot by the political establishment—the “deep state”—to delegitimize his presidency. Mueller’s findings—at least according to Barr—allowed the latter to claim victory. But now, thanks to a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler for the full report, a resolution from the House of Representatives to release the full report to the public (though blocked in the Senate by Mitch McConnell), and popular demand, it’s time for public to judge if that is true. The Mueller investigation will join Watergate, and the Mueller Report will join the 9/11 Commission Report, the Warren Report, and the Starr Report, as one of the most important in history. The Mueller Report is required reading for everyone with Interest in American Politics, for every 2016 and 2020 voter, and every American. It’s now available here as an affordable paperback, featuring an introduction from eminent civil libertarian, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus, and New York Times bestselling author Alan Dershowitz, who provides a constitutional, civil Law-based commentary sorely needed in today’s media landscape.",

    details:
      "Regarded as the second most important book to come out of Nazi Germany, Alfred Rosenberg's Der Mythus des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts is a philosophical and political map which outlines the ideological background to the Nazi Party and maps out how that party viewed society, other races, social ordering, religion, art, Aesthetics and the structure of the state. The 'Mythus' to which Rosenberg (who was also editor of the Nazi Party newspaper) refers was the concept of blood, which, according to the preface, unchains the racial world-revolution. Rosenberg's no-hold barred depiction of the History of Christianity earned it the accusation that it was anti-Christian, and that unjustified controversy overshadowed the most interesting sections of the book which deal with the world racial situation and the demand for racially homogenous states as the only method to preserve individual world cultures. Rosenberg was hanged at Nuremberg on charges of 'waging wars of aggression' even though he had never served in the military, and it is likely that he was hanged purely because of this book.

What a pity that the modern discoveries in those sciences have not led to any great practical results in the hands of allceo pathic physicians It may even be said that they have done mischief, inasmuch as they have completely de molished the tottering faith of some of the best thinkers of the alloeopathic school in their Materia Medica. A more correct knowledge of the true character of disor ganizations and morbid Products showed conclusively that the curative Resources of the allceopathic Materia Medica were insufficient to restore the original healthy condition of the diseased part, and those physicians had therefore to content themselves with offering the patients learned dissertations on the nature of their sufferings, without being able to afford any relief. To the homcebpathic physician. However, the investiga tions of physiologists and pathologists are not lost. They extend his knowledge of the curative relations existing between his remedies and the disease, and enable him to build his Science of therapeutics upon a sure and permanent foundation.

    details:
      "The nine waves is a tour de force. The most entertaining and comprehensive book on Cricket in this country to be published yet, it tells the story of the nine great waves that have rolled through the History of Indian Cricket, from India’s international debut in 1932 to the incredible achievements of viral Kohli’s team today. Each wave or era was chock-full of mesmerizing stars, thrilling moments, great victories, heart-breaking losses and significant turning points—this book tells the story of each of them in great detail. The first wave of Indian Cricket rolled in against the background of momentous changes in the country and the world: Gandhi’s Civil disobedience campaign, world War II and India becoming independent. Through each of the successive waves, India strengthened its position in the Cricketing firmament. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became the most powerful nation in world Cricket—the prowess of the National team today matches the economic strength of the Cricketing establishment. As a five-year-old, the author saw Vijay Hazare, India’s first test-winning Captain, play. Since then he has been witness to some of the most dramatic moments of Indian Cricket: India’s first win in England in 1971, Kapil Dev lifting the world Cup in 1983 at Lord’s, Tendulkar’s first test century at old trafford in 1990, Sunil Gavaskar scoring his 30th test century, the 2011 World Cup in India where M. S. Dhoni emulated Kapil Dev, Virat Kohli in 2018 in England proving he is the best batsman in the world today and much more. He brings to the book his first-hand experience of some of the most seminal moments in Indian Cricket, his Encyclopaedic knowledge of the game and his unrivalled ability as a chronicler of the sport to create a magisterial History of Indian Cricket. Once dismissed by the English as the dull Dogs of Cricket, India is now eagerly courted by all Cricketing nations. On the field its Cricketers are displaying skills which make India a world-beater. Over a billion Indians, the greatest fan base in the world, treat their Cricketers as demigods. The nine waves is a fitting testimonial to the game’s only superpower.",
